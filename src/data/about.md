I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Supply Chain and Information Systems at [Smeal College of Business](https://www.smeal.psu.edu/), Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate enough to work with Prof. [Dan Guide](http://www.personal.psu.edu/drg16/) and Prof. [Saurabh Bansal](https://directory.smeal.psu.edu/sub32). My research primarily focus on closed-loop supply chain, servicizing operations and incentives in supply chain.

Before I joined PhD program at [PennState](https://www.psu.edu/), I got my MA degree in economics from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and bachelor degree in economics from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en).
